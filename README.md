# Repulsion-Based Point Distribution (Prototype)

## Overview
This project is a **prototype** for a repulsion-based point distribution algorithm within a polygon. The main goal is to **visually test algorithm changes** before translating them into a more **optimized implementation in another language**.

## Important Notes
- **Not optimized**: This implementation prioritizes clarity and flexibility over performance.
- **For testing only**: The purpose is to explore and refine the algorithm, not to use it in production.
- **Visual feedback**: Helps assess how changes impact point distribution.

## How It Works
- Generates an initial set of points inside a given polygon.
- Simulates **repulsion forces** between points and polygon edges.
- Iteratively adjusts point positions until a stable distribution is reached.
- Outputs the final point positions for visualization.

## Future Plans
- Once the algorithm is refined, it will be **translated to a more efficient language**

## Usage
Run the script to see the algorithm in action. Modify parameters to test different configurations.
